## For Educative

How I approach a sliding window problem is that I check if there is a size for the window to slide through, if there is non (implicitly or explicitly) then that means I have to increase and decrease the size of the window based on some conditions in the question and flow through it.

## Leetcode

Leetcode showed me shege, but I understand from the questions I have encountered that some sliding window questions are not applied directly on the inputs give a derivative of that input is what the sliding window will be applied on.
