How I approach a sliding window problem is that I check if there is a size for the window to slide through, if there is not then that means I have to increase and decrease the size of the window based on some conditions in the question and flow through it.

Leetcode
Leetcode showed me shege, but I understand from the questions I have encountered is that some sliding windows are not applied directly on the inputs give a derivative of that input is what the sliding window will be applied on
